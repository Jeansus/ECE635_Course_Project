# ECE635_Course_Project

## Motivation
Obtain practical knowledge and experience with applied Machine Learning through understanding and implementing TartanVO: a Generalizable Learning-based VO.

## Design Goals
Develop deep learning tracking algorithm for two mobile systems.

## Deliverables
- Implement and understand an end-to-end learning approach for tracking â€“ TartanVO
- Benchmark TartanVO on two datasets to evaluate its performance (data & code provided)
- Analyze performance difference across datasets and reason about it

## System Blocks
